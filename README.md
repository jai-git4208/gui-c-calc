# AI-Powered Calculator

A C-based calculator application featuring a handwritten digit recognition system trained on the MNIST dataset.

## Features

- **Standard Calculator**: Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).
- **History Sidebar**: View past calculations.
- **Handwritten Input**: Draw digits (0-9) on a grid to input them into the calculator.
- **Neural Network**: Custom-built 2-layer neural network (784 -> 128 -> 10) implemented in pure C.

## Requirements

- C Compiler (GCC/Clang)
- SDL2 Library

## Build & Run

### 1. Train the Model
First, you need to train the neural network on the MNIST dataset to generate the `model.bin` file.

```bash
# Compile the trainer
cc -O2 -o train train.c -lm

# Run training (takes a few seconds)
./train
```
*Note: Ensure the MNIST dataset files are located in the `dataset/` directory.*

### 2. Build the Calculator
Once `model.bin` is generated, compile and run the calculator.

```bash
# Compile the calculator
cc -O2 -o calc main.c -lSDL2 -lm

# Run the app
./calc
```

## Usage

1. **Calculator Mode**: Use the on-screen buttons or keyboard to perform calculations.
2. **Draw Mode**: 
   - Click the **DRAW** button.
   - Draw a digit on the 16x16 grid.
   - Wait ~0.8s for the AI to predict the digit and insert it into the display.
   - Click **CLR** to clear the grid manually.
3. **History**: Click **HIST** to view calculation history.

## Project Structure

- `main.c`: Calculator application source code (UI + Inference).
- `train.c`: Neural network training program.
- `model.h`: Shared header for neural network structures and inference.
- `model.bin`: Trained model weights (generated by `train`).
- `dataset/`: Directory containing MNIST data files.
